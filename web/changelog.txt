I might end up removing it alltogether.</i>
*Changed the Gaia Guardian's health to 800 (from 300) and the damage cap to 35 (from 12), 50 if it's a crit. In a way, if you're properly prepared, the boss is actually easier now as it's definitely possible to hit that hard with the proper enchants and potions, it just requires preparation.

*Fixed a circular dependency chain with DragonAPI not allowing for the game to load.
*Fixed Red Stringed Conparators only seeing half of a double chest.

*Mana Lenses can now be made with Glass as well as Glass Panes, because if you're low enough that you can't make panes it becomes a pain. <i>Ha, I made a funny.</i>
r1.7 211
*Added even MORE tiny potato variants :D

So this line should read "Fixed the Flugel Tiara's sprint delay being 1.5 seconds rather than the intended 2 seconds", but the intended was 3 seconds before and 2 seconds now because 2 seconds feels better than 3 seconds. I don't even know.
*Fixed the Hand of Ender being stackable.

*Added NEI recipe handling for floating special flower recipes. (Tonius)
*Added some secret codes. <i>(these are client only, server owners don't need to worry :3)</i>
*Fixed a crash when the alfheim portal is clicked with a wand of the forest from a dispenser.
*Fixed all sounds depending on the "Friendly Creatures" volume bar and actually split them properly.
*Fixed some typos. <i>I can into english</i>.
*Fixed the Gaia Guardian's health bar flickering weirdly when it's spawning in multiplayer.
*Fixed the Hardmode Gaia Guardian's drop table having Mana Pearls twice rather than Mana Pearls and Mana Diamonds.
*Fixed the Livingwood and Crystal bows not having a proper render.
*Fixed the Mana Mirror trying to update on the server side, causing some desyncs sometimes. I think. I can't reproduce this issue so this is just a wild guess.
*Fixed the tutorial arrows never pointing properly to the next/prev page buttons in the index pages, causing the tutorial to get stuck if the book had elven knowledge.
*Implemented regex based fake player checking. Not 100%, but should catch most of them.
*Mana Spreaders can now be sleeved with wool by right clicking them with a wool block. This makes them colorful and fancy and also muffles the shooting sound.
*Pylons now give out some light.
*Renamed some achievements.
*Replaced instances of ticksExisted with an internal timer in the magic missile class used by the hardmode Gaia Guardian and the Rod of the Unstable Reservoir. May or may not fix hangs with cauldron servers.
r1.5 165
*Fixed a spark crash when trying to remove an augment.
*Fixed Livingwood Bows not consuming arrows.
*Fixed missing icons "mushroom16" and "corporeaIndex" being thrown to the console. <i>I take this very seriously, it's annoying >.<</i>

r1.5 164

*Added a Crystal Bow, a bow that creates arrows with mana and fires faster than normal.
*Added a Livingwood Bow that acts as a normal bow but repairs with mana.
*Added decorative glowing mushrooms of all 16 colors. You can also find them underground. (Yes there's a config, get off my lawn!)
*Added Mana Infused String as a crafting component.
*Added the Ring of Correction. A ring that will swap your active tool (the one you have in hand) with the correct one for the block you're trying to break, works for mana tools only.
*Changed the Terrasteel crafting page to say that there actually is a piece of livingrock below the plate, since nobody seems to get it.
*Fixed fake players being able to equip baubles via right click, which led to a crash with Autonomous Activators from TE.
*Fixed the background of lexicon entry buttons being black if the entry is priority elven knowledge.
*Fixed the Elementium Sword giving a 50% boost to pixie spawn chance rather than 5%.
*Fixed the Petal Apothecary eating Buckets. Also it being able to have water AND lava at once, what's up with that?
*Fixed the Terra Blade not being able to actively repair with mana.

*[API] Increased version number to 34.
r1.5 163

*[API] Added oreDark (from Evilcraft) to the orechid weight map.
*[API] Increased version number to 33.
r1.5 162
*<i>This line is here only to make the changelog look larger than it actually is. Did it work?</i>
*Fixed the Corporea Funnel not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the Ring of Magnetization not ignoring AE2 crystal seeds. <i>Fireball tricked me with the wrong IDs last time but this time I foiled his plans to foil my plans by getting them right, muahahaha! ...I'm tired.</i>
*Reordered some things in the mana part of the creative tab to make more sense. <i>I'm very perfectionist.</i>
r1.5 161
*Fixed server crash >.<
r1.5 160
*<i>Huh, 1.4 was shortlived.</i>
*<b>Added a new "Ender Artefacts" category to the Lexica Botania</b>, it contains new and old ender related things. Some entries from other categories have been moved over to this.
*<b>Added a Tutorial Mode</b> which guides you through the pages you should read, in order, to get a good understanding of the mod's basics.
*<b>Added Corporea, a new mechanic that allows for item verbal requesting.</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HcUMVJKoX8">Here</a>'s a video of it in action while it was still in development, it looks a bit cooler now.<i>This is by no means meant to be an AE replacement or competitor, just throwing it out there.</i>
*Added a Bottle of Ender Air, used as a crafting material and as means to create renewable End Stone.
*Added End Stone Bricks and Chiseled End Stone Bricks. <i>It's totally a good addition, stop judging me!</i>
*Added more alternate textures in the Unity texture pack style by Tobbvald to join those by Futureazoo, you can enable them in the config file.
*Added some disclaimers to the lexicon that shears made of mana materials will trigger tripwire and that blood magic messes with the fallen kanade (if BM is loaded).
*Changed some recipes to use a Bottle of Ender Air.
*Changed the creative tab so all the fluff (decorative blocks and the like) is right at the end rather than in the middle.
*Changed the texture for Livingwood, Dreamwood and the Lexica Botania to new, more detailed textures also by Tobbvald.
*Fixed a timing related dupe with Force Relays.

*Fixed the Thorn Chakram and Enchanted Soil not being in the creative tab.
*[API] Added hooks for corporea stuff.

r1.4 159

*Fixed a crash with the Force Relay and Warp Lens.
*Fixed particles being able to spawn in the client world and chunkloading somehow.
r1.4 158
*Added a new Mana Lens: Warp. It teleports bursts around. It lets you make quarries (good luck with that).
*Fixed potions IDs being set to a value over 127 by default and added a check to change the old configs to a new proper value, networking passes the values as a byte, which means anything over 127 got messed up and crashed the game.
*Fixed the particle render messing up other mods' renders when very far from 0,0. (Gwani)
*Made the Rod of the Unstable Reservoir and Rod of the Shaded Mesa use Dreamwood Twigs in the crafting recipe.
*[API] Added setCollidedAt to IManaBurst
*[API] Updated version number to 31
r1.4 157
*Added a sanity check in the case that a brew is null for some reason, previously it would crash the nei lookup.
*Changed the film grain shader again to fix AMD cards not working, again. I don't have an AMD card to test so fingers crossed it works this time.
*Fixed Overgrowth Seeds not generating as chest loot.
r1.4 156
*Fixed a crash when the Elementium Axe killed a player and dropped a skull.
*Fixed the game completely freezing on the mojang splash screen on some AMD graphics cards. Technical details can be found <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/commit/f8b0f2155d97944fcec7ab315864bb5f86ed9f54">here</a>.
*Fixed the Mana Enchanter adding enchantments twice to items that already have an NBT compound for some reason.
*Fixed the Trodden Dirt Slabs giving the wrong block when picked in creative.
r1.4 155
*Added a proper config for potion IDs rather than letting them auto-assign.
*Changed the Ring of Chordata to check for air levels a bit better so it works properly with Mariculture.
*Fixed Ancient Wills working without the full armor set.
*Fixed Black Lotuses spawning on jungle temple dispensers rather than chests.
*Fixed Mobs' AI getting stuck in the terrasteel plate.
*Fixed the floating flowers with effects being affected by Enchanted Soil.
*Fixed the mana cost bar rendering more than once in the lexicon or NEI if a recipe with more than 100k mana cost was inserted via the api or minetweaker.
*Moved the Crafting Table HUD icon on the Assembly Halo down a bit so it doesn't render behind the text.
*Moved the Greater Band of Aura's output back a bit, it's not as strong as it used to be, but it's a bit better than last update.
*Removed the text that states Terrasteel Armor has HP boost as that was removed last version.
*The Gaia Guardian now has slighty better fake player checker code and can no longer be killed by TT dynamism tablets. Sorry!
*The Greater Bands of Aura and Mana are now crafted both with a single Terrasteel Ingot rather than two.
*The Soujourner's and Globetrotter's Sashes now actively try to change step height rather than on equip only.
*Thermalilies are now faster and make more mana per bucket of lava. However, after they go in a cooldown period after consuming a bucket. Also removed the obsidian config option as it's pretty useless anyway and made it non-elven knowledge again.
*(Technical) The lexicon's GUI now keeps the ItemStack used to open it to render the name, rather than pulling it from the current equipped stack.
r1.4 154
*<i>Holy moley, that's a long changelog. I apologize in advance if anything in this build is broken. I don't do "exclusive beta testing", and since this is a large version there'll probably be some kinks. I'll try my best to iron them out over the next couple of days!</i>
*Added 25 achievements, 20 are progression/side things and the other 4 are special challenges. <i>There's also one more achievement but we don't talk about that one.</i>
*Added 5 new flowers.<ul><li>Spectranthemum, functional, teleports items from around it to a defined point in the world. (Elven Knowledge)</li><li>Medumone, functional, freezes mobs in place.</li><li>Marimorphosis, functional, turns standard vanilla Stone into colored, decorative, stone variants depending on biome.</li><li>Narslimmus, generating, kills natural spawned slimes in slime chunks for mana, doesn't drop slimeballs or split them in two.</li><li>Spectrolus, generating, uses all 16 colors of wool sequentually to create mana.</li></ul>
*Added a "Complex Brews" page, with 6 new brews, 5 featuring new potion effects.<ul><li>Overload: A bunch of effects, Strength, Speed, Weakneess and Hunger.</li><li>Crossed Souls: Killing a mob gives the killer a bit of their HP.</li><li>Feather Feet: Fall damage immunity.</li><li>Vanity's Emptiness: Prevents mob spawns in a 128 block radius.</li><li>Crimson Shade: Removes mob spawn restrictions in a 64 block radius. (eg. Mobs can spawn in broad daylight, slimes in non-slime chunks, etc)</li><li>Marine Allure: Doubles the speed at which fishing rods work.</li></ul>
*Added a Gaia Spirit Ingot, used to summon a hard mode Gaia Guardian, it's harder, better, faster and stronger. It also drops moar lootz.
*Added Ancient Wills. Items that can crafted with a Terrasteel Helmet to provide for very powerful abilities. How do you get them? Who knows.
*Added armor set bonuses to sets of mana armor that apply when all 4 pieces are equipped.<ul><li>Manasteel: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools.</li><li>Elementium: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools, pixies apply random potion effects.</li><li>Terrasteel: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools, regeneration still works even when the food bar isn't topped off.</li></ul>
*Added Crafting Patterns, upgrades of sorts to the Crafty Crate which prevent items from going into slots. There's 9 basic ones that can be used for simple recipes: 1x1, 2x2, 1x2, 2x1, 1x3, 3x1, 2x3, 3x2 and Donut.
*Added Dreamwood Twigs, used to craft Elementium Tools instead of Livingwood Twigs.
*Added Mana Diamond and Dragonstone storage blocks.
*Added Overgrowth Seeds. A new dungeon loot item that allows you to enchant a piece of grass, making any flowers on it work at twice the speed.
*Added Sanity Checks to the lexicon GUIs to prevent crashing if one tries to open a page that doesn't exist. This is important for third party minetweaker support. (SoundLogic)
*Added Spellbinding Cloth. Combine it with an item to remove any enchants it has. <i>This one actually is a carbon copy of the one in Thaumic Tinkerer, this item is like a legacy in my mods. Surprised I hadn't stolen it from TT yet :V</i>
*Added the Lens Clip, an addon to the Mana Blaster that allows it to carry 6 lenses rather than just 1.
*Added the Manaseer Monocle, a new amulet bauble that allows the wearer to see mana bursts even if there's something blocking the view.
*Added the Rod of the Depths, a variant to the Rod of the Lands that places cobblestone.
*Added the Rod of the Molten Core. Almost a carbon copy of the Efreet's Flame Wand Focus from Thaumic Tinkerer. Look at a block and hold it to smelt it.
*Added the Thorn Chakram. A throwable weapon that bounces off blocks. <i>Yes, it's from terraria, shut up.</i>
*Added the World Seed. A new (stackable) item that can be used to instantly teleport to the world's spawn point case the user is at least 24 blocks away.
*Added Trodden Dirt Slabs.
*Baubles now detect the "first tick" using hash codes. This is a lot more reliable than using the old entity time method.
*Changed some lexicon text to make more sense on the small details.
*Changed the Gaia Guardian's Landmine particles to look a bit better and not be as tricky to spot.
*Changed the Trodden Dirt recipe to use Sand instead of Gravel.
*Fixed a crash regarding dominant sparks when there's no other sparks available for transfer.
*Fixed dying Composite Lenses removing the composite component.<i>Took me long enough.</i>
*Fixed the Abstruse Platform recipe having stack size 0 for the components and causing divide by zero crashes with the NEI shift-[?] feature. <i>(Why does that even check the stack size? O.o)</i>
*Fixed the Assembly Halo consuming Blood Magic orbs and potentially other items whose container item is the item itself.
*Fixed the Life Imbuer spawning client-side only mobs.
*Fixed the Mana Enchanter and Mana Flash blocks appearing in the search creative tab.
*Fixed the Red String Container not passing markDirty() calls to the bound block and causing it not to sync to the client.
*Fixed the Ring of Far Reach adding insane amounts of reach if one travels between dimensions.
*Fixed the Ring of Far Reach removing flight <i>(and breaking whatever arcane sorcery was behind the Angel Ring in Extra Utils)</i>.
*Fixed the Soulscribe being able to automatically repair with mana like a Manasteel Sword can.
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer not breaking blocks in AoE at X=0 or Z=0.
*Fixed the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate desyncing if the server is lagging and potentially destroying all the mana used if one picks up the item too early in those circumstances.
*Made the Black Lotus rarely appear in Bonus Chests.
*Made the Fallen Kanade not work in the end to prevent cheesing the Ender Dragon.
*Mana Sparks now try to update the list of sparks they can transfer to after they're done ticking. Dominant Sparks will also attempt to pull mana from sparks at random rather than iteratively. When a Mana Pool with a Dominant Spark is charging an item and is full, instead of pulling from one Mana Pool exclusively it randomly pulls from all possible pools around.
*Mana Tablets now render on the player's belt, if there's one.
*Mana tools now have right click abilities. The Pickaxe places a torch from the inventory, the Axe does the same for a sapling and the Shovel works as a Hoe.
*Nerfed the Bands of Aura. A lot.
*Removed the health boost from Terrasteel Armor.
*Removed the item name remapper. It's completely useless at this point unless by some reason you're updating from a 10 month old build. It was also breaking downgrading as it was trying to remap items that didn't exist. 
*Removed the transparency in the HUD mana bars, as it looked absolutely god awful in higher resolutions/scales.
*The Elementium Pickaxe (and Elementium Tipped Terra Shatterer) will now look in the ore dictionary for what blocks not to break. Should help with Underground Biomes and other mods that add new stones.
*The Lexica Botania's in hand animation uses partial ticks now and isn't locked to 20fps any more. It looks so much smoother. <i>GLORIOUS 60FPS PC MASTER RACE</i>
*The Mana Prism can now be turned off with a redstone signal.
*The Tiny Potato can now be named in an anvil. It can also sing.
*Trodden Dirt now expands to a full block if there's a block above it.
*[API] Added IBurstViewerBauble for a bauble that acts as the Manaseer Monocle.
*[API] Added IManaDiscoutArmor. Pretty self explanatory.
*[API] Added methods to ManaItemHandler for handling mana discount for tools.
*[API] Added remove() to LexiconRecipeMappings. (SoundLogic)
*[API] Updated version number to 30.
r1.3 153
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer being able to break bedrock and other unbreakable blocks.
r1.3 152
*Added the Black Lotus, a dungeon loot consumable that can be tossed onto a Mana Pool for a boost of mana.
*Added the Mana Prism, a new block that can change the properties of a Mana Burst on the fly.
*Added Trodden Dirt, a new block that looks great for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path">desire paths</a>. It also gives a slight speed boost. The texture and idea come from <a href="http://redd.it/2sqwu6">/u/LupusX's post on reddit</a>.
*Red String Spoofers will now also connect to mushrooms.
*Shifted the Assembly Halo HUD down 10px so it fits on smaller resolution/render scales.
*The Brewery and Enchanter now have the same progress pie as the Runic Altar.
*The Magnet Ring will no longer pull items that can contain mana, items that are on a terrasteel plate or AE2 crystal seeds.
*(Technical) IManaTrigger blocks with IManaCollisionGhost tile entities will still have their effect triggered. Furthermore IManaTrigger triggers for fake bursts too so that should be checked against.
*[API] Added IManaDissolvable and IDyablePool.
*[API] Increased version number to 29.
r1.3 151
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer.
r1.3 150
*Fixed a crash when using the crafting halo to make extra utils unstable ingots.
*Fixed more tpyos. <i>This is becoming a dank meme.</i>
*Fixed other mods' GUIs turning blue while the mana bar is being rendered. <i>They really should reset the glColor before rendering...</i>
*Fixed the Mana Fluxfield not sending energy to every RF receiver. (yueh)
*Fixed the Mana Fluxfield requiring the CoFH API to be present to work rather than the CoFH Energy API. (Vexatos)
*Fixed tools that break multiple blocks (manasteel shovel, terra shatterer) causing dupes with thermal expansion tanks and strongboxes and potentially other blocks that require exact harvest method call order.
r1.3 149
*Fixed Dominant Sparks being able to pull from blocks other than Mana Pools.
*Fixed Flashes dropping themselves.
*Moved the following flowers to elven knowledge: Thermalily, Kekimurus, Heisei Dream, Orechid, Loonium.
*Open Crates will now eject into the block below not only if it's an air block but also if it has no collision box. So yes, you can drop stuff on water now.
r1.3 148
*<i>I could have fit this on 147 but I only decided to do it later :V</i>
*Added support for <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445251-1-7-10-beta-wip-colored-light-progress-and">Colored Lights</a>. (<a href="http://puu.sh/dKo8o/7c34ca4d3d.png">Picture 1</a>) (<a href="http://puu.sh/dKozh/323db4f589.png">Picture 2</a>) You can find it in the following blocks:<ul><li>Glimmering Flowers</li><li>Floating Flowers (colored normal ones only)</li><li>Buried Petals</li><li>Sea Lanterns</li><li>Flashes</li></ul>
*Buried petals now emit a faint light.
*Fixed mobs' pathfinding getting stuck in Flashes.
r1.3 147
*<i>Just a small update to fix a major issue and a major annoyance.</i>
*Fixed a crash when placing a comparator next to a brewery.
*Fixed flowers sometimes rendering as floating due to the Y position shift in the render.
r1.3 146
*<i>Added some christmas spark. ARE YOU JINGLING YOUR BELLS YET?!</i>
*Fixed a major dupe with the Assembly Halo where right clicking a recipe would allow for more than one item to be crafted at once using only one set of resources.
*Fixed the render for the flowers not randomizing the position in the Z axis like vanilla flowers do. It still randomizes in the Y axis unlike vanilla flowers because I think it looks good.
*Sparks now properly check against how much space is left on the target block and don't try to put in more mana than available, actually making spark networks viable. <i>You can all point and laugh now.</i>
*The Assembly Halo is now more forceful with checking the validity of a recipe. It can no longer craft recipes purely from memory (and allowing as a way to craft things that have been changed since)
*The Mana Mirror now checks for the pool on update and has a backlog for calls inbetween. It also works cross dimension a lot better.
*[API] Added getAvailableSpaceForMana() to ISparkAttachable. This is very important and breaks backwards compatibility. If anyone is using that interface please adapt ASAP.
*[API] Increased version number to 28.
r1.3 145
*Added the Mana Lens: Flash. It makes fancy lights!
*Botania Flowers now shift a bit depending on position similarly to vanilla flowers since 1.7. <i>About time.</i>
*Fixed Botania slabs breaking lighting on adjacent blocks.
*Increased the endoflame's radius by one block northwest so it's a proper centered square now.
*The potion effects brews (and the tainted blood pendant) create now have semi transparent particles smilarly to beacons.
*The Rod of Terra Firma now works with Podzol.
*Tweaked the Assembly Halo so that the crafting table always faces the player when the item is equipped.
*[API] Added getSubTileAsFloatingFlowerStack() to the internal method handler.
*[API] Increased Version Number to 27.
r1.3 144

*Fixed some entities not being named.
*Fixed the Assembly Halo getting recipe events from mod blocks and creating cheaty recipes.
*Fixed the Rod of the Unstable Reservoir not dealing player damage.

*[API] Added a IFlowerlessBiome interface for biomes. (SpitefulFox)
*[API] Increased version number to 26.
r1.3 143
*Fixed Dedicated Server crashing.
r1.3 142
*Added the Assembly Halo, a portable crafting solution.
*Adding lava to the petal apothecary turns it into a brazier/incinerator.
*Changed Hydroangeas' recipe to use Cyan petals rather than Light Blue ones.
*Fixed the Signal Flare item crashing if an invalid color is loaded somehow.
*Hydroangeas are now more dilligent at picking up water blocks.
*INTENSIFIED GOLDFISH
*Renamed a bunch of rods so they all are in the same name scheme and theme.
*[API] Added aditional SubTileEntity interaction methods. onBlockPlacedBy(), onBlockActivated(), onBlockAdded(), onBlockHarvested() and getDrops() (LiamEarle)
*[API] Increased version number to 25.
r1.3 141
*Added Alchemy recipes to break down Clay and Brick blocks.
*Moved Terrasteel Armor hp boost values around so the amount is relative to the amount of materials used for crafting. Total is still 20.
*The Tiny Potato now emits heart particles when it's right cli- <i>...what am I doing with my life?</i>
r1.3 140
*Added two new Baubles, the Cloaks of Virtue and Sin. Their effects trigger when the player takes damage.
*All non-ring baubles now render on the player, fancy!
*Fixed flowers not ticking properly if the doDaylightCycle gamerule is set to false.
*Fixed the Halo on the Flugel wings rendering 1.62 blocks higher than normal on other players in multiplayer.
*Fixed the Rod of the Arcane Barrage crashing servers >_>
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer and Elementium Shovel having not working if the player's reach is above 4.5 (with the ring of far reach for example).
*Gave some more damage to the Rod of the Arcane Barrage.
*[API] Added IBaubleRender.
*[API] SubTileEntities now have an internal ticker.
*[API] Updated version number to 24.
r1.3 139
*Added the Rod of the Arcane Barrage. The thing from the last update.
*Fixed BuildCraft gates not being localized. (sb023612)
*Fixed the Petal Apothecary consuming water bottles and added support for Forge IFluidContainerItem. (ganymedes01)
*Made the color for the floating island texture a bit more saturated. (Yulife)
*The shedding pages now properly use the world instance for creating entities. Should fix crashes with Fossils & Archeology. (SoundLogic)
r1.3 138
*"Added" a new item that works but is creative only for now, I'll work on it some more later >_>
*Added a proper, registered dependency on Baubles. <i>Only took over 100 versions to do it /o/</i>
*Fixed dreamwood not going to the right page when shift-right clicked with the lexicon.
*Fixed the color of Rainbow bursts and Gaia Spirits not changing in Mystcraft ages.
*Fixed the Rod of the Skies and Hells not showing a mana bar. 
*The enchanter will now always properly reset the pylons' particle emitting status.
r1.3 137
*Fixed RedStringRenderer looking for the codechicken Vector3 rather than the botania one. On other words, Fixed the game crashing if you have a wand of the forest equipped while you have a red string block in the world and codechickencore isn't installed.
*Fixed the Red Stringed Spoofer not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer not actively restoring its damage like the manasteel tools do.
*Fixed the recipes for breaking back Reed and Thatch blocks giving items with metadata 1, and thus unusable.
r1.3 136
*<b>Added Red String and Red Stringed Blocks</b>. These can interact with other blocks remotely.
*Calling setWater on the petal apothecary now calls for a block update. <i>This is technical stuff for other modders only.</i>
*Changed some minor details in some lexicon entries so they are accurate to recent changes.
*Changed the brewery texture to a more appropriate one. (Yulife)
*Combining a Floating (any color) Flower with any botania flower with an effect (manastar, pure daisy, any generating or functional...) will replace the flower there with the one you put. The flower will still act like normally, but has the visual and technical properties of a Floating Flower.
*Fixed mod slabs letting light pass through.
*Fixed some tpyos in the elven lore page. <i>I desperately need someone to proofread the nonsense I write.</i>
*Fixed the game crashing if one tries to look up uses for the Tainted Blood Pendant in NEI.
*Fixed the runic altar not saving the amount of mana it should get (and thus causing the amount of mana it has to reset to 0 when it loads back).
*Fixed there being a missing texture on the terra plate, resulting in some unneeded log errors.
*Having Night Vision on a Tainted Blood Pendant will no longer make the brightness blink obnoxiously.
*Hopefully fixed entry sharing being somewhat fiddly in SMP.
*Removed the text that says that Bursts would work in the Terrasteel crafting, because it seems everyone gets confused and decides not to use sparks even though it clearly says it's the best way >.<
*The Terra Shatterer should no longer break blocks on the client side only and require a relog.
r1.3 135
*Added some more info to the Spark page.
*Fixed the terrasteel plate not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the terrasteel plate not taking the player to the Terrasteel entry when shift-right clicked with the lexicon.
*Removing sparks is now done via shift-right click, normal right click now shows which sparks it can connect to.
*The Gaia Guardian now spawns a few less mobs and spawns them in a smaller radius. It won't spawn pig zombies or spiders any more, but you might get witches.
*When a spark is placed in the world it displays what sparks it can connect to, this can be duplicated by right clicking it with a wand.
r1.3 134
*Fixed crash when looking at a mana pool if dark quartz is disabled in the config.
*Fixed the terrasteel plate taking mana from spreaders even if it isn't active.
*Spark particles are now a bit more subtle and have more color variation.
*Thatch and Reed blocks can now be broken down into their components.
r1.3 133
*<b>Build 132 was supposed to be 1.3, not this, but this one works too.</b> <i>All this stuff was to be in 132 but I wanted to play The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, since that came out, y'know...</i>
*<b>1.7.2 is no longer supported.</b>
*Added a Brew of Restoration, it's like the brew of Revitalization but it's Regeneration I for 2 minutes and uses redstone in the crafting.
*Added new lore/backstory pages for the events that separated the elves' world from the overworld. It's worth a read, but not required. Some text in the original entries was also changed to reflect.
*Added the Tainted Blood Pendant, it can store potions and give the player their effects while it's worn, for the cost of mana.
*Added the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate, which serves as the new method to create Terrasteel. You'd be wise to look at the Terrasteel page to check out how it works. It's pretty similar to the old method but allows for more control and can be done earlier in the game.
*Changed the Gaia Guardian fight a whole bunch, it's harder now to compensate for the new items and the fact that it can take damage from the Terra Blade now. Brews and a Terra Blade are a must now. The entry in the lexicon now describes the recommended gear. You can see what it does for yourself ;)
*Fixed the Alfglass recipe using Glass instead of Managlass as it should.
*Fixed the Brew of Mending not working.
*Fixed the Brewery breaking instantly. Added added the proper block texture for breaking.

*Added a config option to disable the Mana Enchanter.
*Added the Crimson Pendant, a "tier 2" Pyroclast Pendant that does what the old one used to pre-nerf.
*Added the Hand of Ender, an item that allows not only for access of one's ender chest, but of others' via right clicking on them. (the last feature can be toggled in the config).
*Added The Spectator, a new bauble that lets you search for items in inventories, dropped around, in players/horses' inventories, equipped by mobs and that villagers trade.
*Changed the recipe for the Pyroclast Pendant to make more sense with the recent nerf.
*The Pixies the Gaia Guardian spawns no longer take non-player damage, so you can't cheese the battle with Tiny Planet + Terra Blade. <i>Sorry Lewis :3</i>
r1.1 94
*Added Mob Spawners to the Botania creative tab. Using a spawn egg on them changes the mob it's spawning, similar to MC:PE.
*Added the Ender Overseer, a new block that detects when players are looking at it and gives out a redstone signal.

*Actually fix the skull renderer because I'm an undereducated idiot who has no clue what they're doing or how the java compiler works :V
r1.1 92

*Hopperhocks will no longer pick items up right after a mana pool crafts them.
*I was playing with TC and realized I wanted Botania armor mixed in with the Goggles of Revealing, so you can do that now.
*Lowered the chance for the Lexica Botania to spawn in the Bonus Chest, according to almighty reddit it was too high.
*Player heads now render with the hat/hair layer as they do in the normal model, so your crafted heads won't look weird now. Thanks to Kihira for this!

r1.1 90
*Added a new generating flower, the Gourmaryllis, it eats food to make mana, but there's a catch...

*Lowered default flower quantity and density to 2 and 16 respectively (was 3 and 32).
*Lowered default villager shed avg interval from 82000 to 226000 (this won't affect old configs).
*The Hopperhock is now more efficient at picking up items and picks up any it can find instead of just one at a time, this makes automating systems that require timing a lot easier.
*The Hopperhock now respects inventory max stack sizes.
*The Mana Enchanter is more expensive and puts less empahsis in the rarity of the enchantment.
*The Mana Pool no longer has a cooldown between being able to craft items but rather a timer on when it can "re-craft" an item after it crafted it (see wood log transmutation for example).

*The Petal Apothecary now has a smarter checking for what it considers seeds. Read: Natura Hop<i>seed</i> wood won't work now :p
*Tweaked the Mana Burst particles, now they never leave any empty space between them, so you get a proper straight burst when you fire it with a mana blaster instead of a bunch of loose particles. The color and size also randomizes a bit to make each burst distint, even if just by a bit.
r1.1 83
*Changed the Lexicon HUD icon to be a lot less intrusive.
*Fixed Gaia Pylons' in-world lexicon click going to the wrong entry.

*Fixed Bifrost blocks being pickupable in creative.
*Fixed some seeds not getting picked up by the petal apothecary (any registered with "Seed" in the name rather than "seed" because the check was case sensitive). (ganymedes01)

*The Flugel Tiara is now made with Elementium.

*Added <a href="https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/484136285251309568">Matrix Mode</a> as a config option. This was a visual glitch I got while changing the particle code that I decided to leave in because it was funny.
r1.1 69
*Added a new lens (that requires elven knowledge), the Paintslinger Lens.
*Changed the Pixie Dust texture to be pink to match the other elven resources and the pixie mob texture. <i>You were waiting for it, confess.</i>

r1.1 63
*Fixed generating flowers in the corners of chunks (and in general) causing lots of unnecessary chunk updates.
*Fixed lack of canUpdate() override on TileManaVoid, in theory this shouldn't impact performance unless you somehow had hundreds of them, but it fixes MCPC+ complaining. <i>/shrug.</i>

I can't exactly tell you if that is the case though, because this issue is completely sporadic and nigh-on impossible to reproduce with consistency. <i><b>Warning</b>: This change modifies API files SubTileGenerating.java and SubTileFunctional.java. Third time's the charm, right? Please be so.</i>
*Mana Mirrors no longer show their binding in the tooltip, but rather in world.

*Added the Manastar flower (under the Mana Manipulation section), which lets you measure if you're getting a profit or loss of mana.
*Droped the nerfhammer on Dayblooms and Nightshades. To start off, they're a bit slower by default now. They also suffer diminshing returns from having any flowers of the same type adjacent. Go get creative with better mana generation methods now.
*Moar references!
r1.0 45
*Temporarilly removed the auto downloader, the reason can be found <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2440071-botania-an-innovative-natural-magic-themed-tech-mod-not-in-beta-any-more/page__st__420#entry31815845">here</a>.
